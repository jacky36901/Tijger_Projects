Project Details
Hi Guys,
Very Nice to meet you all here!

So the Project details is to scrape all data of the products from this Website  https://think2.eu and write them to a database. 
All details and price should be included and status like (out of stock, reserved, available) should be present. 
The bot should run the loop infinetly to update the listings so you will need to make a put request for products already in the database and a post for new products. These status like (Out of stock, reserverd, available) will change constantly... so that's why we need you to update or add them. And a seperate function that delete the listings if its not available anymore by checking whether the url exists or not.
If the URL is present, the listing should deleted.

So, In a summary,

We need a seperate program to scrape and update the men. a seperate for the women and a seperate program to delete the listings

When the listing is out of stock it should be removed from the database

When the listing is reserved it should be removed from the database too.

So we only have POST and DELETE request.
